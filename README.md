# w3x4_w2encoders_teensy2.0

This is my try to create a code for my handwired micropad for davinci resolve software.
i use a Mac so some changes may need it in case you are using a windows pc
and i have adjust the commands to my pins. you need to adjust it to the pins that you are using.
If you have some corrections for the code please let me know.

I hope at least i gave you a good start for your code
its my first one, so im new to programming keyboards.

Next keyboard coming soon will be with a pro micro and one encoder.
